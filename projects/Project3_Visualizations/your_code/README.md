Last weekend was the 2020 dtd run which is a 10 mile run from the center of Amsterdam to Zaandam. I participated in this run many times although the last time was 2017. This year unfortunately due to corona the 2020 edition was cancelled.

To bring back some good memories about the event this analysis us focused about some myths that my friends and I generated during the years. 

	1.Is there are relation between speed and distance the participants lives from Amsterdam?

	2.The longer it takes you to cross the start line after the start signal will have a negative effect on your end time.

	3.Male participants cross the start line faster than female runners. Therefore have a lower difference between gun time and real time

	4.In 2019 the run was held on a very hot day. Is there a difference between the average speed of 2019 and the other years.
