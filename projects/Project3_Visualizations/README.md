# Guided Project: Visualizing Real World Data

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data.

**You will be working individually for this project.**

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

Come up with an interesting research question and find data to answer your question.  
- Create a Jupyter notebook or Python file to analyze the data.
 - Using your data, create a minimum of one scatter plot, one histogram, one box plot and one bar graph (you can add more than one visualization of each type of you choose). 
 Your plots should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis and units of the quantities plotted (if applicable) as well as a title for the graph.
 - Feel free to use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly as you see fit to best convey
   the message and the story behind the data.
- Using a SQL DB is recommended but not mandatory. 

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 7 minutes max.
* Q & A: 3 minutes.
* **Total Time:** 10 minutes.

### Outputs

* Present a slideshow in which you present your findings. Make sure this slide show is structured. You may use a Jupyter notebook slideshow similar to the one used in the lectures, but this is not mandatory.  
* Explain your research question(s), thought process and learnings. 
* Explain *how* the visuals help you explain your questions. 


## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your branch:

- **Python files** and **Jupyter notebooks**. These files should be self sufficient. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebooks and understand your analysis. Make sure your notebooks look clean and well documented by making proper use of comments, docstrings and markdowns. We strongly suggest to start the notebook with and Introduction and conclude it with a Conclusions section. 
- **An empty data folder** with a readme file inside that explains the data set
 
  
The following deliverables should **NOT** be pushed to your branch
but stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Cq1u10UHATWauvB9aurxaWzhGUF9VyQ?usp=sharing) 

- **A slide deck** containing your analysis and your visualisations.
- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. Remember to use relative paths in the notebook. The link in the notebook can point to the original data set or to our google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Cq1u10UHATWauvB9aurxaWzhGUF9VyQ?usp=sharing) <br>

## Resources and suggestions

* **Find a data set to process** <br>
A great place to start looking would be <br>
[Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)<br> 
[Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)<br>
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)<br> 
A great new source is the <br> [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
* **Resources for Markdown in Jupyter** <br>
    * [Short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBCB23pQeIA)
    * [Article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-jupyter-notebook-formatting-guide-873ab39f765e)
    * You may also find inspiration from the jupyter notebooks you have worked on for your labs
* **Perform Preliminary Analysis** - use functions like `describe` to help guide you to the correct insight and data visualization
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of the different types of visualizations and when to use them should come in handy with this assignment
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want


## Useful questions to ask yourself

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?


This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
