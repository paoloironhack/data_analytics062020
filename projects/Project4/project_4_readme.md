# Project: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice all the skills you've learned so far. The focus of this project in particular is statistics. 

**You will be working in groups for this project.**

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

- Come up with an interesting research question and find data to answer your question. Having a research question or set of questions is particularly important for this project! 
- Create a Jupyter notebook or Python file to analyze the data.
 - Create at least two confidence intervals, two one-sample hypothesis tests (z-test and/or t-test), two two-sample hypothesis tests (z-test and/or t-test). 
 - Feel free to use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly as you see fit to best convey
   the message and the story behind the data.
- Store your data in a SQL Database. 

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 12 minutes max.
* Q & A: 3 minutes.
* **Total Time:** 15 minutes.

### Outputs

* Present a slideshow in which you present your findings. Make sure this slide show is structured. You may use a Jupyter notebook slideshow similar to the one used in the lectures, but this is not mandatory.  
* Explain your research question(s), thought process and learnings. 
* Explain *how* the visuals help you explain your questions. 
* Explain *how* the statistics help you explain your questions. Do not simply mention the outcome values of your tests. 

## Necessary Deliverables

* **Project repository** 
 - Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include  
   - A **.gitignore**  file that blocks any images and datafiles, 
   - A **README file** to guide the reader through the project and files and also have a functional file structure. The README file should clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to. 
   - As  repository template you could use the repository you created  for project2
   - **A data folder** with an additional **README.md file** inside that explains the data set. (Without README file in the data folder you will not be able to push the folder because empty folders are not accepted by git)
  - **Please add the repository link on the excel sheet on our g. drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q5Ao2rJbzb4KVvby3foPwla-CGxipLWr)**
<br>
* **Python files** and **Jupyter notebooks**<br>
These files should be self sufficient. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebooks and understand your analysis. Make sure your notebooks looks clean and well documented by making proper use of comments, docstrings and markdowns to tell your story. 
  -  **We strongly suggest to start the n otebook files with and Introduction and conclude it with a Conclusions section**
  - We encourage you to produce **meaningful and clear plots** adjusted to the data you want to present and to make proper use of   font(size), labels, contrasts, legends  and colors to make memorable the story you want to tell audience.


The following deliverables should **NOT be pushed** to your group's repository
but **stored on your group folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIDpffMj5iQ5xKKGV3nSKM38buvRM6jp?usp=sharing)**

- **A presentation deck (slides)** containing your analysis and your visualizations.
- **DATA <br>
Please do not upload any data (or SQL database) to the repository** but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder (with README file in it) Remember to use relative paths in the notebook. The link in the notebook can point to the original data set or to your group's data folder on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIDpffMj5iQ5xKKGV3nSKM38buvRM6jp?usp=sharing) <br>

- **SQL Database**
The data should be stored (on g.drive) as SQL database. You can then decide to do the analysis with pandas or  using SQL, **but storing the data as database is mandatory**

## Useful questions to ask yourself

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?


This will be useful as an overall gauge whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
