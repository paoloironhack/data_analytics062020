## Overview

The goal of this project is to allow you to demonstrate the skills you have built throughout this program. In this project, you will use Python, SQL, and Tableau to put together a complete analytics workflow, including:

* Data acquisition
* Data wrangling
* Data storage
* Data exploration and analysis
* Statistical Modelling
* Feature selection
* Machine learning model training
* Model evaluation
* Reporting and presentation of your insights

The final project is structured into 4 phases and 3 weeks. You will have to come up with a plan for what you are going to do and then design the project around the data set or data sets that you have chosen.

**You will be working individually.** However, keep in mind that we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. You will be working on this project over the course of 3 weeks. The suggested phase-wise structure is listed below. Use it as a guideline to keep your work structured but if you feel like you have a working flow, feel free to manage the project however you like.

Remember, however, that data analysis is an iterative process. From time to time, therefore, you may need to step back to a previous phase to revisit the data, your code or your analysis. It is advised that you start with a small and reasonable scope and only gradually increase the scope of your project. 

### Phase 1 - Brain Storming and Data Preparation

* Idea generation & planning
* Formulate clear hypotheses / research questions
* Data gathering & cleaning
* Data storage

Identify topics of interest, and see if there is available data. Ideally, formulate questions you want to answer. At the end of this phase, if someone asks you what you are working on, you should be able to easily answer in one sentence.

### Phase 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

* Data exploration
* Data transformation
* Data visualisation
* Test your hypotheses / questions
* Come up with compelling stories

Start exploring and getting familiar with the available data. Here you should also acquaint with the data by making visualisations and performing descriptive and inferential statistical tests. 

### Phase 3 - Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling

* Feature selection
* Model training and evaluation
* Predictive Analysis

### Phase 4 - Data Analysis on Repeat and Presentation

* Compare and evaluate various models
* Investigate additional questions
* Explore new avenues 

* Pick the most interesting findings
* Create your story
* Prepare your presentation

## Project Instructions

### Phase 1

During the first phase of your project, you will be planning your project, exploring datasets and generating ideas. Ideally, you'll come up with a plan on what you want to accomplish in the following three weeks. It helps to conduct some "preliminary analyses" and explore various avenues to test the feasibility of your ideas.

### Phase 2

In the second phase of your project, you will start by preparing your data. You will explore, analyse, and visualise the data using Python or Tableau, applying the variety of techniques you learned throughout the program.

Make sure to categorise your notebooks in logical groups. Make it a habit of adding comments in code cells or markdown cells so that you always remember what you have done. Invest time in staying organised, your future self will thank you later. Summarise your findings and don't be scared to discard things that don't help you in moving forward.

### Phase 3

In this phase, you should be finalising the first iteration of your project. Ideally, this is within the second week so that you have enough time to re-iterate, improve, dig deeper and prepare your final presentation.

Also, here you will be using the analysis you performed and the insights you discovered in the previous phases to help frame your machine learning problem. You can then select and engineer appropriate features, train your models, and evaluate performance.

* If you are planning on doing supervised machine learning, identify the target variable you would like to train a model to predict. Also, determine whether you will be doing regression (target variable is continuous) or classification (target variable is discrete).
* Perform feature selection/engineering to arrive at the features you feel best to represent the problem you are trying to solve. During this stage, you may need to normalise or scale your variables.
* Train a couple machine learning models on the data.
* Evaluate the performance of the models.
* Prepare a presentation of your findings and results.
* Sketch a story around your points

Once you reach this point, ask fellow students, friends or teaching staff for feedback and ideas to dig deeper.

### Phase 4

At this point, you should have a clear idea of where you want to go. You should spend the remaining days refining your machine learning models and your presentation. Spend some time to get a deeper understanding of the algorithms or statistical methods you are using and how your work could be improved. Think about how you can best present your project to a broad audience so that they take away what the essence of your project is.

As to the predictive part of your project, you might want to:

* Introduce new models and continue iterating on your machine learning models to optimise their performance. 
* Organise your machine learning steps into a pipeline that performs feature selection/engineering, model training, model evaluation, and model storage.
* Further refine your presentation based on additional findings and results.

In general, for your presentation, keep in mind that:

* Create stories around your key points
* Pick the most suitable visualisations to support your stories
* Identify easy-to-grasp examples to put your findings in perspective
* Combine your insights, visualisations and stories into a presentation 

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables **SHOULD BE** pushed to your Github repo.

* A (or multiple) Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file(s) containing all your Python code and/or a (or multiple) Python (.py) files. 
* Database credentials and/or the Tableau credentials. If you want to keep these private, please provide a link to a video where you show your demo. (Optional)

The following deliverables **MAY NOT**  be pushed to your Github repo.

- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. 
- **Presentation Slides** Your final project presentation <br>

## 5 Tips for Successful Completion

* Generate a project idea that solves a data problem with practical values. Make sure the problem you try to solve is clearly defined. Make sure the scope of the problem is manageable so that you can complete within the project time frame. Meanwhile, think beyond the problem itself - can your solution of the problem inform how to solve other bigger/deeper problems?

* Obtain timely feedback on your ideas, plans, progress, and products from the instructional staff. This ensures you stay on the right track and deliver impressive results.

* Be prepared for technical difficulties. Manage your time wisely and pace yourself. Stick to the project agenda strictly.

* Commit your codes and push to Github on regular basis. You should commit every time you complete a task and push at least once a day. This will help you avoid accidental data loss and is also the easiest way to document your iterative development process.

* Before final project presentation, test every component and step of your demo. Make sure your demo will run smoothly.


#### Additional Ideas

##### Analyze Your Own Facebook Data

Do you know you can download your own Facebook data to your hard disk? You can use this data to do social network analysis or visualize your friendships.

**Warning: Downloading your Facebook data takes a lot of time.** You need to first request your data in your Facebook account. Then Facebook will prepare your data for you to download as a ZIP file. If you request all your data (e.g. posts, photos, likes, friends, places, etc.), it takes at least a whole day for Facebook to get your data ready. But instead of requesting all your data, you can also request only the categories you want to analyze, such as friends and places, which takes significantly less time. In either case, request your data as early as you can so that you can have the data before the project week begins.

Besides, when you request your data from Facebook, choose if you would like the data to be in JSON or HTML format. It's a strategic choice depending on what topic you want to work on for your final project. If you request JSON, you will be able to focus on data visualization and analysis. If you request HTML, the data may be more suitable for natural language processing, but you will need to spend time on parsing the HTML data.
