# Welcome to the Machine Learning Project!

## The Main Goals 

The overarching goal of this project is twofold:

1. Learn to learn new tools and methodologies. In other words, as a data analyst you need to be able to keep up with developments in the field and teach yourself new tools. This is, therefore, an important part of the project. 

2. Focus on learning a skill that is transferable to the final project. Ideally, in the final project you come up with a good question or idea for a project or product. This will take time. Moreover, implementing your ideas will also take a lot of time. For this reason, it is helpful if you already now a bit about predictive modelling, NLP or computer vision. It will save you a lot of research time. 

Also keep in mind that:

1. This will be an individual project.

2. We will mentor you (Paolo: classical predictive analyses; Louk: the others). 

## Four Key Areas  

In this project you will focus on a machine learning analysis in one of the following 4 areas:

### Classical Predictive Analysis
* For instance, predict housing prices based on data.
* Time series 

### Natural Language Processing
* For instance, doing sentiment analysis on bol.com reviews;
* For instance, build a chatbot. 

### Vision and/or object detection;
* For instance, facial recognition 
* For instance, recognizing the creator of a work of art.

### Reinforcement and generative learning;

* For instance, teach a computer to generate new images of people.  

Each student should select one area to focus on. 

## Project Description

Because the project is outlined along 4 themes, each theme has slightly different goals and requirements.  

## Project Goals and Requirements 

### Classical Predictive Analysis
* Come up with a clear research question and testable hypotheses.
* Apply the programming and ML techniques we have learned as well as some new techniques. 
* Build and compare at least 4 ML models, one of which must be a model we have not discussed before (e.g. ridge regression).
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your models. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

### Natural Language Processing
* Design and build an NLP prototype. 
* Integrate a machine learning algorithm in an NLP framework (e.g. a chatbot or sentiment analyzer)  
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate your working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

### Vision and/or object detection
* Build a machine learning model (neural network or another advanced model) to perform object detection tasks. 
* Demonstrate your knowledge of the model by presenting how it works and why you have designed it in this way. 
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate a working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

### Reinforcement and generative learning
* Build a machine learning model (neural network) to generate new data or learn a new skill.  
* Demonstrate your knowledge of the model by presenting how it works and why you have designed it in this way. 
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate a working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.





# Necessary Deliverables

* **Project repository** <br>
 **Please add the repository link on the excel sheet on our g. drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rg6Wrmvp996TZaG4nkhMi0Kv0anTNQMQ?usp=sharing).** 
 Your repository must be clean and organized. As repository template you could use the repository you created for project2; 
 this means that it must include  
   - A **.gitignore**  file that blocks any images and datafiles, 
   - A **README file** to guide the reader through the project and files and also have a functional file structure. The README file should clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to. 
   - **A data folder** with an additional **README.md file** inside that explains the data set. (Without README file in the data folder you will not be able to push the folder because empty folders are not accepted by git)
   - **Python files** and **Jupyter notebooks**<br>
These files should be self sufficient. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebooks and understand your analysis. Make sure your notebooks look clean and well documented by making proper use of comments, docstrings and markdowns to tell your story. 
      -  **We strongly suggest to start the 
    notebook files with and Introduction and conclude it with a Conclusions section**
      - We encourage you to produce      **meaningful and clear plots** adjusted to the data you want to present and to make proper use of   font(size), labels, contrasts, legends  and colors to make memorable the story you want to tell audience.


The following deliverables should **NOT be pushed** to your repository
but **stored on your folder** [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rg6Wrmvp996TZaG4nkhMi0Kv0anTNQMQ?usp=sharing)

- **A presentation deck (slides)** containing your analysis and your visualizations. You will have to present using a slideshow or a complete workable programme, **NOT A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.** <br>
- **DATA <br>
Please do not upload any data (or SQL database) to the repository** but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder (with README file in it) Remember to use relative paths in the notebook. The link in the notebook can point to the original data set or to your data folder on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rg6Wrmvp996TZaG4nkhMi0Kv0anTNQMQ?usp=sharing) <br>

<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help but also remember: Google is your friend!
* Start simple! 
* Learn about your subject and understand what research has been done already.
* You *can* use data from the projects your partners did in the last weeks. You can't use your own project.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
* Use the notebook and markdown to guide the reader through your analysis and tell the story
* Explain what insight or information is inferred from your visualizations
* Make extensive use of comments, docstrings and markdown
