    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "A significant part of programming involves dealing with errors and exceptions. Beginner Python programmers might initially find errors annoying - constantly reminding you that you did something wrong and presenting you with obstacles in your quest for a solution that works. However, as you progress from beginner to intermediate, you will start to increasingly rely on error messages to write better code. You will learn to view errors and exceptions more as a form of communication that informs you about what is wrong with the code you are writing and where the error is occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will familiarize ourselves with the different types of errors and exceptions we might encounter in the Python code we write, learn how to write exceptions into our own code, and learn how to handle errors in different ways."

    "In this lesson, we learned about Python errors. We began by learning some of the common error types and when they are raised. We then learned how to read Python error messages and trace back the errors we get to determine their source. We also learned how to write code that raises errors, and about exception handling using try, except, else, and finally clauses. Finally, we got a glimpse into how you can write more complex and comprehensive exception handling into your code. You should now have a better understanding of errors you may encounter when programming with Python and how to address them. "
